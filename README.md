## Problem Description
//Why people find it difficult to use plots
* How to plot data


## BOT Description
Tagline: **Plotbot**<br>
// Write about matplotlib and its uses. What kind of users use this.
// Using Python language matplotlib library.  
* This is a chatbot interface that will help the user to get the right graph for their data.
* This bot will not only provide with correct function but also its usage by providing a sample source code.
* The user can also test the correctness of the plot by visualizing their data input on the plot generated by the bot.
* The types of plots the bot can plot are:
 * Line graph
 * Histogram
 * Scatterplot
 * Piechart
 * Box-plot
 * 3D plot


## Use cases
This is an example use case:
```
Use Case1: Give the user the right plot name with code snippet.
1 Preconditions
   User must have mattermost account.
2 Main Flow
   //User will request meeting and provide list of attendees [S1]. Bot will provide  possible meeting times and user confirms [S2]. Bot creates meeting and posts link [S3].
3 Subflows
  //[S1] User provides /meeting command with @username,@username list.
  //[S2] Bot will return list of meeting times. User will confirm time.
  //[S3] Bot will create meeting and post link to google calendar event.
4 Alternative Flows
  //[E1] No team members are available.
```
```
Use Case2: Plot the graph for the user with their sample data.
1 Preconditions
   User must have mattermost account.
   User must give the data in the format required by the bot.
2 Main Flow
   //User will request meeting and provide list of attendees [S1]. Bot will provide  possible meeting times and user confirms [S2]. Bot creates meeting and posts link [S3].
3 Subflows
  //[S1] User provides /meeting command with @username,@username list.
  //[S2] Bot will return list of meeting times. User will confirm time.
  //[S3] Bot will create meeting and post link to google calendar event.
4 Alternative Flows
  //[E1] No team members are available.
```
```
Use Case3: Provide admin with the ability to configure new plots into the server database.
1 Preconditions
  The admin must have a mattermost account.
  The admin must have permissions to configure the bot.
2 Main Flow
   //User will request meeting and provide list of attendees [S1]. Bot will provide  possible meeting times and user confirms [S2]. Bot creates meeting and posts link [S3].
