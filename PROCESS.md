# Milestone: PROCESS

For this milestone, we worked on implementing our use cases and applying software processes and practices.

For each use case, we implemented the basic flow described by the use case. We implemented a minimal proof of concept (that covered all our use cases).

### Process
For building our software we went through careful planning and delegation of work by conducting two sprints of one week each, as part of our process milestone. Wherein, at the beginning of each sprint we discussed any remaining tasks and assigned them equally to each team member.

For both the sprints,
* We divided our use cases into stories/tasks. 
* Assigned story points (1,3,5,8) to each user story
* Assigned a team member, who is committed to complete the story by the end of the iteration.

We utilized the kanban board (Github project). We used notes to indicate the story points and developer assigned for each tasks

#### Sprint 1:
* Wed Oct 23-- Fri Nov 1
In this Sprint, we aimed at replacing our mocking functionality with the actual service and divided the tasks accordingly.

#### Sprint 2:
* Sat Nov 2--Fri Nov 8th
This sprint was aimed at completing the remaining tasks for the POC and assignations accordingly.

We found the [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) method a good way plan tasks.


### Practices

For our software process, we followed a "scrumban" methodology, that is a blend of kanban and scrum practices. 

Furthermore, identify at least one core practice and collary practice not already part of your software process. Integrate those practices in your software development.

Keep meeting notes and documentation of following these practices and include in your submission.

### Consistency

Work must be equally divided among the team. Furthermore, the work should be completed uniformly.

Creating tasks on the last day of submission **will not receive credit**. Completing a story on the last day of an iteration will not (generally) receive credit. Teams with uneven contributions, will not receive credit.

Plan ahead.



In your markdown, include:

* Documentation on story creation and assignment at EACH iteration (one option is to include screenshots of kanban board).
* Any scrum meeting notes/process notes
* Include documentation of EACH iteration end. Include status of completed and incomplete tasks, and a process reflection.
