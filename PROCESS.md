# Milestone: PROCESS

For this milestone, we worked on implementing our use cases and applying software processes and practices.

For each use case, we implemented the basic flow described by the use case. We implemented a minimal proof of concept (that covered all our use cases).

### Process
For building our software we went through careful planning and delegation of work by conducting two sprints of one week each, as part of our process milestone. Wherein, at the beginning of each sprint we discussed any remaining tasks and assigned them equally to each team member.

For both the sprints,
* We divided our use cases into stories/tasks. 
* Assigned story points (1,3,5,8) to each user story
* Assigned a team member, who is committed to complete the story by the end of the iteration.

We utilized the kanban board (Github project). We used notes to indicate the story points and developer assigned for each tasks

#### Sprint 1:
* Wed Oct 23-- Fri Nov 1 --> [Iteration start meeting notes](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-22/projects/1#column-3515) <br/>
In this Sprint, we aimed at replacing our mocking functionality with the actual service and divided the tasks accordingly. 


#### Sprint 2:
* Sat Nov 2--Fri Nov 8th --> [Iteration start meeting notes](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-22/projects/1#column-3598) <br/>
This sprint was aimed at completing the remaining tasks for the POC and assignations accordingly.

We found the [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) method to plan our tasks.


### Practices

#### Core practice: Scrumban methodology
For our software process, we followed a "scrumban" methodology, that is a blend of kanban and scrum practices.
We did this by holding biweekly scrum meetings and maintaining a Kanban board for our tasks.

#### Corollary practice: Code Reviews (Pull Requests)
Another practice we followed were code reviews. Each of us created a seperate branch for our tasks, and once those tasks were complete, we created a PR and assigned it to one of our team members for review. Once the reviewer reviews the code, they will merge the code into the master branch.

### Consistency

Work was equally divided among the team. Also, the work was completed uniformly.
Each of the team member had approximately 12 Story points worth of work.
And these tasks were assigned at the beginning of each sprint

In your markdown, include:

* Documentation on story creation and assignment at EACH iteration (one option is to include screenshots of kanban board).
* Any scrum meeting notes/process notes
* Include documentation of EACH iteration end. Include status of completed and incomplete tasks, and a process reflection.
