# Milestone: DEPLOYMENT

In the previous milestone, we implemented the services required for your use cases and implemented interaction with a bot. In this milestone, you will be demonstrating a fully deployed version of your bot for use in a Slack/Mattermost/Github/etc. environment.

### Deployment

Using a configuring management tool, you must fully provision and configure a remote environment for your bot. You should largely be able to reuse homework materials but adopted for your bot.

In your README.md, document how these configuration management tools and deployment scripts should be run and make sure to include demonstrate running them in your screencast.

### Acceptance Testing

For your DevBots, create a test team and a TA user account, which TAs will be using for testing your deployed bot. For github bots, grant the necessary permissions for performing tasks on a demo repository. 

Provide **login credentials** for TA.

### . To initiate converstion with plotbot
1.Log-in to [mattermost client](http://ec2-18-217-150-234.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8065).
2. Enter the username as **evaluator** and password as **evaluator**.
3. After successfully logging in, navigate to "evaluation" channel and execute the testcases given in the acceptance test plan below. 

### 2.Three usecases to be tested. <br>

**Usecase 1: Give the user with code snippet for reuired type of graph**
In the first use case, the user can request to provide sample of code snippet and a sample of plot for a particular plot type. Our bot can provide samples codes and plot for only scatterplot, barplot and boxplot.
1. The user requests for a sample of scatterplot
```sh
Input:
sample scatterplot
```
`Expected output`:

2. The user requests for a sample of barplot
```sh
Input:
sample barplot
```
`Expected output`: 

<img width="420" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/13071/files/0481f480-1392-11ea-9c43-d0537c2665da">

3. The user requests for a sample of boxplot
```sh
Input:
sample boxplot
```
`Expected output`: 

<img width="420" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/13071/files/0481f480-1392-11ea-9c43-d0537c2665da">

4. When user requests for a plot which is not supported (example countplot)
```sh
Input:
sample countplot
```
```sh
Expected output:
Requested plot sample not available
```
**Usecase 2: Plot the graph for the user with their custom data.**
In this use case, the user can request for a plot to be generated by either uploading the dataset or using the pre uplodaed datasets and providing the axis information (i.e. X axis and Y axis labels). The bot reponds with the plot generated.
```
Usage: 
Text: plot <plot-type> <dataset-name> <x-axis_label> <y-axis_label>
Attached file: CSV of dataset
```
```
Note the following:
1. x-axis and y-axis labels are column names in the dataset, so they should match.
2. The column names should be in lowercase.
3. The plot-type supports only for 'scatterplot', 'boxplot' and 'barplot'.
4. You can download the test datasets from location given below
5. The trigger word 'plot' has to be in lowercase only.
```
Test Datasets: 
[petals](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-22/blob/master/plotbot/puppeteer/test/dataset.csv) Column names : 
[weather](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-22/blob/master/plotbot/puppeteer/test/weather.csv)

### Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection

You must not hard-code interaction/mock data for your bots. TAs will perform additional exploratory testing and code inspection to verify bots perform as expected and handle edge cases and error in inputs. 

**Failure to adhere to these instructions will result in a 0 for this milestone.**

### Bonus: Continuous Integration (CI) Server

Create a jenkins server and build job that runs a build job for your bot, including running your integration tests. 

CI can run in a local or hosted VM.

To receive create, you must demonstate your CI working based on a build running from a triggered commit, and show build logs with passing integration tests.

### Submit

In your repository, create a new markdown file, DEPLOY.md, with descriptions about the following:

* Deployment scripts
* Acceptance tests
* Final code
* Optional bonus: Code and screencast for continuous integration server.

Due Sunday, December 1st, before midnight.

### Evaluation

* Deployment scripts and screencast (25%)
* Acceptance testing (40%)
* Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection (30%)
* Bonus: Continuous Integration Service (20%)
